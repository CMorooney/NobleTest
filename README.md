Sounds made on eurorack gear.

## Game Instructions
Avoid:
  - getting punched to death by humans
  - letting too many ghosts out the top center of the screen

Attack:
  - humans by rotating the crank -- just one rotation will do but it must be quick!
  - ghosts by waiting until they are within range of the speakers at the top of the screen -- once they are take your hand off the crank and press "A!"


Your health is displayed in the bottom left of the screen. It starts full and as you are hit it depletes to empty. Once it is empty it is GAME OVER.


The ghost escape meter is displayed in the bottom right of the screen. It starts empty and as ghosts escape it fills up. Once it is full it is GAME OVER.


Last as many waves as you can! Every 5 waves the difficulty increases
